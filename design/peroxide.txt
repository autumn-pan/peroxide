Peroxide is a general turing machine framework designed specifically for work on BB(6). It is highly optimized for 2-symbol turing machines.

The idea of Peroxide is to be a decider. I don't know if this decider is either original or feasible, but I will try anyways. I'm calling this technique Exhaustive Reachability (ERA). It consists of running the turing machine in reverse, creating a tree of all possible local configurations that would lead to it halting, and exhaustively proving them unreachable. 
For example, there exists a certain turing machine that I'm technically not supposed to name right not, but it's nonhalting because the halt condition can only occur when the head is left of a very specific pattern. It is provable that this pattern cannot be passed through from the right without altering it, nor can it be formed from the left. Thus, that family of configurations where the head is left of that pattern is unreachable, which means that it must be nonhalting.

Given some turing machine with one and only one halt state, Peroxide will first store the state S where the halt state is in, and write whichever symbol it halts on to a temporary tape. If the machine halts when the machine reads a 0 in state C, the machine will remember that it halts in state C and write that zero to a temporary tape. This tape is then used to create a virtual configuration C_0 where the head is in state S on that cell, such that it will halt on the next step. Then, Peroxide considers all transitions that lead to state S. If no such transition exists, then C_0 is unreachable and the machine is unhalting. Otherwise, there will be some integer n_1 transitions that lead to configuration C_0. Hence, for each transition, there is a configuration C_1_n that halts in 2 steps. This pattern is repeated to create a configuration tree. Of course, it is more than likely that this tree would be of infinite size, which is completely impractical for deciding. There are multiple patterns that can prune a configuration tree
1. Cycling: If the only way to reach a state results in a cycle, it is trivially easy to prove that it is unreachable by induction under certain conditions. This condition was used to solve one specific BB(6) holdout
2. Dead Ends: if there exists no transition to a state, then it is unreachable
3. Breaking: if the end condition assumes that a specific local configuration exists, then it must remain. Being, it should not be broken by any transition, and if it isn't repaired, then the machine will not halt. In fact, if for the last n steps that local configuration is unbroken, step n+1 cannot under any circumstances break the configuration. This case was instrumental for eliminating a large portion of the configuration tree for a specific BB(6) holdout.
4. Parity: In the ending configurations, the head must either be to the left of, to the right of, or somewhere in the middle of some set configuration. Sometimes, it is provable that there is no way the head can appear in that location relative to the configuration. For example, moving the head to that position could break the configuration, or the head could bounce off. One must also consider the fact that the head may not be able to create that configuration AND remain in that position.
There are probably a lot more cases than this, but this these three confitions is sufficient to solve at least a few holdouts. If it is shown that every node of a configuration tree is unreachable, then the machine is nonhalting.
